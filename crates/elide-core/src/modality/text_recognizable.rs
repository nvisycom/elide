//! [`TextRecognizable`]: text recognition over any modality.

use std::ops::Range;

use super::Modality;

/// A modality whose per-chunk payload can be read as text for recognition,
/// and that can place a chunk-local text match into its own location
/// coordinate space.
///
/// This is what the text recognizers (pattern, NER, LLM) require: a way to
/// view the chunk payload as a string ([`as_text`]) and a way to turn a
/// byte range of that string into a modality location ([`locate`]). It does
/// **not** constrain the [`Replacement`] type, so a modality that recognizes
/// over text but redacts in its own medium qualifies.
///
/// [`Text`] and `Tabular` project their payload identically (their payload
/// *is* [`TextData`]). A medium whose recognizable text is not its payload —
/// audio, whose transcript an enricher stamps onto the call's
/// [`Artifact`](Modality::Artifact) — reads it from there instead. Both methods
/// receive the chunk `data` *and* the medium's `artifact` so each modality draws
/// from wherever its text and coordinate metadata live: text from `data`, audio
/// from the artifact.
///
/// [`as_text`]: TextRecognizable::as_text
/// [`locate`]: TextRecognizable::locate
/// [`Replacement`]: Modality::Replacement
/// [`Text`]: crate::modality::text::Text
/// [`TextData`]: crate::modality::text::TextData

    /// the byte range and lifting fills the outer coordinates (a cell's
    /// row/column) later — so it always succeeds. For a medium whose location
    /// is not byte-based (audio time spans, image regions), `locate` resolves
    /// `range` against `artifact` (the transcript's timings, the OCR layout)
    /// into the native coordinate, and returns `None` when no enrichment covers
    /// the range. A caller that gets `None` drops the match rather than emit an
    /// entity that addresses nowhere.
