//! Redaction: the operator contracts for hiding detected entities.
//!
//! An operator reads an [`Entity`] and the [`Data`] under it and
//! *computes* a [`Replacement`] (mask, replace, hash, encrypt, blur, …)
//! without mutating anything; applying the replacement back into the
//! document is the codec's job. The forward direction is [`Operator`];
//! the optional reverse is [`ReversibleOperator`]. Every operator is an
//! [`Operator`]; only reversible ones (encrypt → decrypt) additionally
//! implement [`ReversibleOperator`].
//!
//! This module defines the operator contracts and the [`Redactions`]
//! batch they feed into. Concrete operators and the label→operator
//! registry that selects them live in `elide`.
//!

//! [`Data`]: crate::modality::Modality::Data
